Description: This is a simple helper function that outputs a data frame that can be used to annotate your plot with different letters according to Tukey-HSD significant differences between groups. In addition to the data and formula, the function takes as input a positional variable for placement on the plot, an alpha for the Tukey-HSD test, and a grouping variable for faceted plots.
