Description: This is a simple helper package that outputs a data frame that can be used to annotate your plot with letter codes according to significant differences between groups. It provides functions for the parametric Tukey HSD and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. In addition to the data and formula, the functions take as input a positional variable for placement on the plot, an alpha for the statistical test, and grouping variables for faceted plots, as well as the method for p-value adjustment in the case of the Kruskal-Wallis test.
